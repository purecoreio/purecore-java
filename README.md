## Are you in the right place?

If you are building a Minecraft plugin, this is **not** what you are looking for. You should get a mc-plugin purecore.io instance. In order to do that, please, take a look at the mc-plugin repo to see how to get an existing purecore.io instance on a loaded server.

If you are using purecore.io for editing the core functionality of purecore's java wrapper, this is the place.

In order to code a purecore addon for craftbukkit, forge, or others, just grab the live core instance with getCore(), do **not** create a new Core() object, or you won't be able to access the instance information.
